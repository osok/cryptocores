cryptography ip-cores in vhdl / verilog

The components in this repository are not intended for productional code.
They serve as proof of concept, for example how to implement a pipeline using
only (local) variables instead of (global) signals. Furthermore they were used
how to do a VHDL-to-Verilog conversion for learning purposes.
